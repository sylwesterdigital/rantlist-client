- Added verification for embedded-frame and user-activated external-navigation handling.

## Changes in v0.1.16

- macOS app icon now uses the same icon artwork as the iOS app.

# Rantlist multi-platform release workflow

The release version is always mirrored from `/Users/smielniczuk/Documents/works/stage/chat`; no manual version argument is accepted.

## Platform selection

```bash
./scripts/release_and_deploy_homepage.sh                 # macOS only (default)
./scripts/release_and_deploy_homepage.sh --platform macos
./scripts/release_and_deploy_homepage.sh --platform android
./scripts/release_and_deploy_homepage.sh --platform ios
./scripts/release_and_deploy_homepage.sh --platform macos,android
./scripts/release_and_deploy_homepage.sh --platform all
```

`--macos`, `--android`, `--ios` and `--all` are shorthand equivalents.

A selected release shares one Rantlist source version, one monotonically increasing build number and one Git tag/GitHub Release. The state file records selected and already-built platforms, so a failure after one platform finishes can resume without rebuilding that platform.

## Outputs

macOS produces a Developer ID signed/notarized universal2 DMG, application ZIP and checksum file. Android produces a signed APK, Google Play AAB and checksum file. iOS/iPadOS produces an Xcode-signed App Store-distribution IPA and checksum file.

The common app logo source is `assets/rantlist-logo.svg`; platform icon assets are derived from that SVG.

## Android signing

Run once before the first Android release:

```bash
./scripts/setup_android_release.sh
```

The permanent release keystore is stored outside Git at `~/.config/workwork/rantlist-android-release.keystore`. Its password is stored in macOS Keychain. Back up the keystore securely because future Android upgrades must use the same signing key.

The Android builder expects Android SDK Platform 35 at `~/Library/Android/sdk` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`/`ANDROID_HOME`). Gradle is downloaded into the ignored `.android-build/` cache.

## iOS signing

The iOS project uses Xcode automatic signing with Apple team `5P9V78UZAC` by default. Override with `RANTLIST_APPLE_TEAM_ID` or `RANTLIST_IOS_BUNDLE_ID` if required. Xcode must have an Apple account/team capable of iOS App Store distribution. The generated IPA is suitable as an App Store distribution artifact; normal public iPhone/iPad installation should be through TestFlight or the App Store rather than direct GitHub sideloading.

## macOS media permissions

The macOS app has Hardened Runtime camera/audio-input entitlements plus camera/microphone usage descriptions. macOS still prompts the user on first media use. iOS and Android likewise use native camera/microphone permission handling for WebRTC calls.

## GitHub and homepage

After all selected platform builds pass checksums, the workflow commits/pushes the public client, creates an annotated tag `v<version>-b<build>`, creates a draft GitHub Release, uploads only the selected platform artifacts, and publishes it. The homepage deployment is pinned to that new release. If a platform is not present in the new release, the homepage keeps a download button for the newest earlier verified release that contains that platform.

## Resuming

The active state file is:

```text
release/.release-workflow-state.env
```

Run the same release command again after a failure. Inspect state with:

```bash
./scripts/release_and_deploy_homepage.sh --status
```

Preflight without building:

```bash
./scripts/release_and_deploy_homepage.sh --platform all --preflight-only
```

Abandon an incomplete workflow and allocate a new build number only when deliberately requested:

```bash
./scripts/release_and_deploy_homepage.sh --restart
```

## Website deployment profile

SSH host/port values remain outside the public repository in `~/.config/workwork/rantlist-release.env`, imported from the existing WORKWORK.FUN Cut deployment setup. The Rantlist homepage target is `https://mojoworks.xyz/labs/rantlist/`.

## Android SDK provisioning

Android releases target API 35. The release preflight now uses `sdkmanager` to install
`platforms;android-35`, `build-tools;35.0.0`, and `platform-tools` automatically when
those components are missing. Existing Android SDK licenses are respected; the script
does not silently accept new Android SDK license terms.
